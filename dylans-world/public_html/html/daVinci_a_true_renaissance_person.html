      Introduction
    </h3>
    
    <p class="text">
      Leonardo da Vinci was the quintessential Renaissance person because he invented one type of parachute, painted a painting where he experimented with materials that have never been tested, and created a sketch of a man that represented the ideal anatomy of a human being. These things all show the qualities of the quintessential Renaissance person because da Vinci was multitalented, educated, innovative, curious, and adopted new ideas.

      Who was Leonardo da Vinci?
    </h3>
    
    <p class="text">
      Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in the town Vinci, near Florence. He was a renaissance painter, scientist, architect, and inventor.

      The Parachute
    </h3>
    
    <img src="../assets/daVinci_a_true_renaissance_person/parachute.jpg" alt="Leonardo da Vinci's parachute invention">  
    
    <p class="text">
      Da Vinci used the idea of which air resistance would slow an object down to design an apparatus that would be called the parachute. The parachute would be used and improved on many times later in history. This shows he was a renaissance person because he was self educated and used the education he had to create new and innovative devices people used a lot in the future.

      The Last Supper
    </h3>
    
    <img src=../assets/daVinci_a_true_renaissance_person/thelastsupper.jpg alt="the last supper painting">
      
    <p class="text">
      The painting The Last Supper was of the day before the crucifixion of Jesus. It shows that he adopted new ideas because he experimented with techniques to enhance the color and contrast that could not have be achieved with normal methods. This was to make the features and emotions of faces in the painting more apparent and clear. This shows that he is a renaissance person because he used methods that weren’t used by as many other painters before. He took risk in using a new material people never used much before with the material he was using.

      Vitruvian Man
    </h3>
    
    <img src="../assets/daVinci_a_true_renaissance_person/vitruvianman.jpg" alt="leonardo da vinci's vitruvian man">
      
    <p class="text">
      The Vitruvian Man is a prime example of why Leonardo was a renaissance man because it showed that he was educated and curious. This drawing was based off of Vitruvius’s notes about the human body. This used a lot of math because the size of each body part is based off of each other. He was curious about the human body and while studying it, he drew this. This shows that he was a renaissance man because he was self educated about the human body and while studying proportions of man, he drew this drawing.

      Conclusion
    </h3>
    
    <p class="text">
      In conclusion, Leonardo da Vinci was the quintessential Renaissance person because he was multitalented by being able to perform many things, self educated, innovative, curious, and used new ideas that weren’t used before.
